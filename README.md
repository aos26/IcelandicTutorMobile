It is sufficient to clone the github code to be able to run the code.

For the build gradle we used the following versions:

    compileSdkVersion 29

    buildToolsVersion "29.0.3"

The device emulator is: Pixel 2 API 27 (26 is also acceptable).

It is not necessary to get any external API or other objects to run the application.
